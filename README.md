# WheelIOT- The Smart Wheelchair
We know that the needs of many people with disabilities can be overcome with
power wheelchair, but some portion of this community is finding it difficult to operate due to
many reasons. There are a lot of differently abled people who canâ€™t afford power wheelchairs
because of their high costs or due to the fact that they need extra knowledge to drive the
wheelchair along.
As per a survey ASIA has a total of 400 million disabled people and in particular INDIA,
has 20.68 million people. All these either use the conventional wheelchair or the ones that can
afford costly wheelchairs priced over 50,000/-. Though we have evolved in the field of health
care and technology, but we are still not good enough to solve difficulties of this huge sector of
population that cannot afford power wheelchairs.
So, we have found a way for overcoming these issues and helping out that sector of people who really 
are in need of such facility. The main objective of this project is to felicitate and increase the movement of
people who are handicapped and the ones who are not able to move freely.
Therefore, we are coming up with a design of a wheelchair-WHEELIOT which is
controlled by a joystick. It includes obstacle avoidance technique accompanied with an
emergency button and a health monitoring system.
