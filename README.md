# WheelIOT- The Smart Wheelchair
Abstract: We know that the needs of many people with disabilities can be overcome with power wheelchair, but some portion of this community is finding it difficult to operate due to many reasons. There are a lot of differently abled people who canâ€™t afford power wheelchairs because of their high costs or due to the fact that they need extra knowledge to drive the wheelchair along.
As per a survey ASIA has a total of 400 million disabled people and in particular INDIA, has 20.68 million people. All these either use the conventional wheelchair or the ones that can afford costly wheelchairs priced over 50,000/-. Though we have evolved in the field of health care and technology, but we are still not good enough to solve difficulties of this huge sector of population that cannot afford power wheelchairs.
The main objective of this project is to felicitate and increase the movement of people who are handicapped and the ones who are not able to move freely. Therefore, we are coming up with a design of a wheelchair WheelIOT which is controlled by a joystick. It includes obstacle avoidance technique accompanied with an emergency button and a health monitoring system.
